This is a Turbo-Pascal 6.0 / Borland Pascal 7.0 project of a two-player car racing game, written mainly by a good friend Michail, me, and two other contributors back in 1997. You can execute the RACE.EXE file still in a DOS-box and the game runs flawlessly. Even the execution speed is still as it was back in 1997.

There used to be a bug in the BP7-compiler which lead to crashes on machines with more than 400 MHz back in the early 2000s, but the bug has been fixed and the game recompiled in 2006, if the file date is correct. You can play against another human, using the keyboard, or against a computer opponent. There is a small description of the game. Don't miss the memory screen for Michail, the genius who included all the magic assembler routines. The memory screen is right after the credits.
